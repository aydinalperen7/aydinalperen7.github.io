I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin  [ME-- TFS track](https://www.me.utexas.edu/academics/graduate-program/areas-of-study/thermal-fluid-systems). I am working as a graduate research assistant at ODEN Institute under the supervision of Professor [George Biros](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/parallel-algorithms-for-data-analysis-and-simulation-group/). My research involves parallel computing, machine learning, inverse problems and optimization of additive manufacturing processes. 

I did my undergraduate study in [Bilkent University-- ME department](https://me.bilkent.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey. During my undergraduate studies I did an internship in Turkish Aerospace Industries. During my undergraduate studies I conducted research under the supervision of Dr. Luca Biancofiore. I also conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Alessandro Bottaro in the University of Genoa under the Erasmus+ traineeship program.
